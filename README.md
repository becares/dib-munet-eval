# Evaluation of nn-Unet architecture for Document Image Binarization
## TODOs:
* Solve problem with CUDA compatibility
* Migrate all datasets to the nnUnet format
* Execute dummy training in my laptop
* Migrate to the lab machine and solve problems
* Execute training and hope for not having any errors

## Installation
1. Install conda or miniconda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

2. Execute following command in the desired directory: ``conda env create -f environment.yaml``
